# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and projects for [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/), Harvard University's introduction to programming using Python.

## 🎓 About the Course
CS50P is a focused dive into the Python programming language. Led by **David J. Malan**, the course covers the fundamentals of programming as well as intermediate concepts like regular expressions, object-oriented programming, and unit testing.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Testing:** Pytest (Unit Testing)
- **Libraries:** Requests (APIs), Inflect, Figlet, Validators, Pillow (Image Processing)
- **Data:** CSV, JSON, Regular Expressions (Regex)
- **Concepts:** Functions, Conditionals, Loops, Exceptions, File I/O, OOP (Classes/Objects)

## 📂 Repository Structure
